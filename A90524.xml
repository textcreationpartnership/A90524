            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is ceaſed that I do deny; and if any ſuch word be there writ, that faith is ceaſed, I do it condemn, and upon thee do it return, it being thy own word; for I live by the Faith of the Son of God; which Faith the world knows not: and if this be thy ground that thou haſt againſt the people called Quakers, if I do remove and do it condemn, and do own that Faith which purifieth the heart, which is held in a pure conſcience, and that Scripture I own in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. which faith, without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and my deſire is, that all may come to faith, and to receive the end of their faith, the ſalvation of their ſouls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. which thing was there intended however it was writ, and the writer of it I was not, but that paper I left in the County of <hi>Cheſter</hi> to be copied over, and into another Country I went, and if any thing in it be contrary to the Scriptures, it I do condemn; ſo concerning this thing let thy mouth bo ſtopt, and accuſe not the people called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, with that they are not guilty of, for from ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion do I them clear, and for what thou haſt writ againſt them, from under it canſt thou not get, but under ſhame and condemnation muſt come. And for that Scripture in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. It I do own, and it a witneſs ſtands a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt thee, and a witneſs for us it ſtands, who are and have been kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation: and for the Scriptures which is here writ, them I do own, and this may ſerve in anſwer to thy firſt paper.</p>
               <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, for as much as I ſaid, whereas the ſaid perſons do pretend to be gu ded by the Spirit, I will undertake to prove that it is not the ſpirit of God but of the Divel.</p>
               <p>I prove it thus, firſt he that doth ſo enquire what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence can be betwixt God, Chriſt and Saints, that doth imply there is no difference amongſt them is not in that guided by the ſpirit of God, but by the ſpirit of the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw,</hi> What ſpirit is that, that accuſeth perſons of that which was writ by one perſon, and what ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rit is that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119042:8"/>
which croſſeth Scriptures, and would put a difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, who are of one; for the Apoſtle ſaith, he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſo that ſpirit which makes a difference is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Scriptures, and is not the ſpirit of God, but the ſpirit of the Devil; for it is written, that the Father might be one as we are one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. and it is written, as he is ſo are ye in this preſent world; ſo that ſpirit which divides God, Chriſt, and Saints, and would make them at ods, is not the ſpirit of God bu the ſpirit of the Divel, and with the ſpirit of God it is judged.</p>
               <p>And thou ſaidſt he (ſaid <hi>Tho. Holm</hi>) affirmed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of divers perſons thus, <hi>I am equal with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> that is falſe and a lye, it was not ſo ſpoken by <hi>Tho. Holme</hi> and to this thou was fully anſwered, and <hi>Tho. Holms</hi> was denied to be equal with God, but thou haſt made lyes thy refuge, as thy forefathers did which went before, and he that lies is of the Devil, for there is no lye of the truth.</p>
               <p>And thou ſaieſt he that ſaith it is ſo, what is due to God it due to a Saint, is not in this guided by the ſpirit of God but by the ſpirit of the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What is due to God thou giveſt him not, and what is due unto Saints thou knoweſt not, but what is due to the wicked thou firſt muſt know, and judgement is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to God, to the Son, and to the Saints, and their judgement is one, for the Saints ſhall judge the world, and Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.23. and this honour have all the Saints, they bind the Kings in chains, and Lords in iron bands, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 149.7, 8, 9. verſes; and the Saints are heirs, and co heirs with the Son, and the Son thought it no robbery to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the father, and ye all one one inheritance. (And the Son prayed) that the Father might be one, even as we are one, <hi>Joh</hi> 17.11. And thou who would divide Father, Son, and Saints, is not guided by the ſpirit of God, but by the ſpirit of the Divel, which croſſeth and is contrary to the Scriptures, and for the Scriptures thou haſt brought in,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119042:8"/>
them I do own, but thy end in bringing them in I do deny, who brings in Scriptures for thy own ends, which makes not for thy purpoſe.</p>
               <p>So this may ſerve in Anſwer to thy papers, and may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie all that reads this, that faith we do own, which is the gift of God, and do not it deny, neither it deſtroy, though we witneſs to him bear, who is the end of our faith, the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. So now upon thee do I lay all thy boaſting words, which from the pride and envy of thy heart was given forth to prove and make good what thou haſt written, elſe all the country which have ſeen thy paper will witneſs againſt thee, and thy ſhame and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they muſt own, which thy due and portion is for thy envy againſt the truth.</p>
